# Rollpkg

üåé Zero config solution for building packages with [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) (supports JavaScript too).

üåè Rollpkg creates `esm`, `cjs` and `umd` builds for development and production, and fully supports tree shaking.

üåç Default configs are provided for TypeScript, Prettier, ESLint, and Jest for a complete zero config setup.

## Setup `rollpkg`

#### Prerequisites

Initialize with `git` and `npm`. Note that the docs use `npm`, but it works just as well with `yarn`.

```
mkdir <package-name>
cd <package-name>
git init
npm init
```

#### Install `rollpkg` and `typescript`

```
npm install --save-dev rollpkg typescript
```

#### Add `main`, `module`, `types`, and `sideEffects` fields to `package.json`

Rollpkg uses a convention over configuration approach, so the values in `package.json` need to be exactly as listed below, just fill in your `<package-name>` and you‚Äôre good to go. Note that for scoped packages where `"name": "@scope/<package-name>"`, use `<scope-package-name>` for the `main` and `module` fields.

```
{
  "name": "<package-name>",
  ...
  "main": "dist/<package-name>.cjs.js",
  "module": "dist/<package-name>.esm.js",
  "types": "dist/index.d.ts",
  "sideEffects": false | true,
  ...
}
```

> Note about `sideEffects`: most packages should set `"sideEffects": false` to fully enable tree shaking. A side effect is code that effects the global space when the script is run even if the `import` is never used, for example a polyfill that automatically polyfills a feature when the script is run would set `sideEffects: true`. For more info see the [Webpack docs](https://webpack.js.org/guides/tree-shaking/#mark-the-file-as-side-effect-free) (note that Rollpkg doesn't support an array of filenames containing side effects like Webpack).

#### Add `build`, `watch` and `prepublishOnly` scripts to `package.json`

```
"scripts": {
  "build": "rollpkg build",
  "watch": "rollpkg watch",
  "prepublishOnly": "npm run build"
}
```

#### Add a `files` array with `dist` to `package.json`

This [lets `npm` know to include the `dist` folder](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/configuring-npm/package-json#files) when you publish your package.

```
"files": [
  "dist"
]
```

#### Create a `tsconfig.json` file and extend the `tsconfig` provided by Rollpkg

```
// tsconfig.json
{
  "extends": "rollpkg/configs/tsconfig.json"
}
```

#### Add `dist` to `.gitignore`

Rollpkg outputs the builds to the `dist` folder, and this shouldn't be checked into version control.

```gitignore
# .gitignore file
node_modules
dist
```

#### Create an `index.ts` or `index.tsx` entry file in the `src` folder

This entry file is required by Rollpkg and it is the only file that has to be TypeScript, the rest of your source files can be JavaScript if you'd like. Note that you can write your entire code in `index.ts` or `index.tsx` if you only need one file.

```
package-name
‚îú‚îÄnode_modules
‚îú‚îÄsrc
‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄindex.ts | index.tsx
‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄadditional source files
‚îú‚îÄ.gitignore
‚îú‚îÄpackage-lock.json
‚îú‚îÄpackage.json
‚îú‚îÄREADME.md
‚îî‚îÄtsconfig.json
```

#### While developing use the `build` and `watch` scripts

```
npm run build
# OR
npm run watch
```

#### Publish when ready

```
npm version patch | minor | major
npm publish
```

#### That‚Äôs it!

No complex options to understand or insignificant decisions to make, just sensible defaults for building packages with Rollup and TypeScript. This is what you get with Rollpkg:

- Zero config builds for ES Modules `esm`, CommonJS `cjs`, and Universal Module Definition `umd` into the `dist` folder.
- The builds are created using the TypeScript compiler (not Babel) so they are fully type checked.
- The `esm` build supports tree shaking and is ready to be used in development and production by modern bundlers (e.g. Webpack).
- The `cjs` build comes with both development and production versions, and will automatically select the appropriate version when it's used.
- The `umd` build comes with both development and production versions and is ready to be used directly in the browser from the Unpkg CDN.
- Production builds are minified and any code that is gated by `if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production') {...}` or `if (__DEV__) {...}` is removed. Also, if using an `invariant` library like [tiny-invariant](https://github.com/alexreardon/tiny-invariant), `invariant(condition, message)` will be transformed into `invariant(condition)` in production builds.

### Fully setup example `package.json`

This includes the optional [Rollpkg default configs](#using-default-configs-optional) and is setup to use [`npm link` for development](#package-development-with-npm-link).

```json
{
  "name": "<package-name>",
  "version": "0.0.0",
  "description": "Some awesome package",
  "main": "dist/<package-name>.cjs.js",
  "module": "dist/<package-name>.esm.js",
  "types": "dist/index.d.ts",
  "sideEffects": false,
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "npm link && npm run watch && npm unlink -g",
    "build": "rollpkg build",
    "watch": "rollpkg watch",
    "prepublishOnly": "npm run lint && npm test && npm run build",
    "lint": "eslint src",
    "test": "jest",
    "test:watch": "jest --watchAll",
    "coverage": "npx live-server coverage/lcov-report"
  },
  "files": ["dist"],
  "devDependencies": {
    "rollpkg": "^0.1.0",
    "typescript": "^4.0.3"
  },
  "prettier": "rollpkg/configs/prettier.json",
  "eslintConfig": {
    "extends": ["./node_modules/rollpkg/configs/eslint"]
  },
  "jest": {
    "preset": "rollpkg"
  }
}
```

---

## Using default configs (optional)

Rollpkg provides sensible defaults for common configs that can be used for a complete zero config setup. Default configs are provided for [TypeScript](#typescript-config), [Prettier](#prettier-config), [ESLint](#eslint-config), and [Jest](#jest-config) (the configs are setup to work with TypeScript, JavaScript, and React). Use of these configs is optional and while they include support for React, using React is not a requirement (they work just fine without React).

---

### TypeScript config

Having a `tsconfig.json` is a requirement of Rollpkg because it uses the TypeScript compiler to compile both TypeScript and JavaScript source files. It is recommended to extend the [Rollpkg `tsconfig`](https://github.com/rafgraph/rollpkg/blob/main/configs/tsconfig.json) and add your own options after extending it, however, extending the Rollpkg `tsconfig` is not a requirement. For more info see the [TypeScript compilation and JS APIs](#typescript-compilation-and-js-apis) section.

```
// tsconfig.json
{
  "extends": "rollpkg/configs/tsconfig.json",
  // add your own options, etc...
}
```

---

### Prettier config

If you want to use [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) (recommended) you can extend the [config provided by Rollpkg](https://github.com/rafgraph/rollpkg/blob/main/configs/prettier.json). There is no need to install Prettier as it is included with Rollpkg. In `package.json` add:

```
"prettier": "rollpkg/configs/prettier.json"
```

You may also want to set up a pre-commit hook using [`pre-commit`](https://github.com/observing/pre-commit) or [`husky`](https://github.com/typicode/husky) and [`lint-staged`](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged) so any changes are auto-formatted before being committed. See the [`rollpkg-example-package`](https://github.com/rafgraph/rollpkg-example-package) for an example pre-commit hook setup, as well as the [Prettier docs for Git hooks](https://prettier.io/docs/en/precommit.html).

---

### ESLint config

If you want to use [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) (recommended) you can extend the [config provided by Rollpkg](https://github.com/rafgraph/rollpkg/blob/main/configs/eslint.js). It includes support for TypeScript, JavaScript, React, Prettier, and Jest. The provided ESLint config mostly just extends the recommended defaults for each plugin. There is no need to install ESLint or specific plugins as they are included with Rollpkg. In `package.json` add:

> Note that the path includes `./node_modules/...`, this is because in order for ESLint to resolve `extends` it requires either a path to the config, or for the config to be published in its [own package named `eslint-config-...`](https://eslint.org/docs/developer-guide/shareable-configs), which may happen at some point, but for now it will remain a part of Rollpkg for easy development.

```
"eslintConfig": {
  "extends": ["./node_modules/rollpkg/configs/eslint"]
}
```

It is also recommended to add a `lint` script to `package.json` (the `eslint src` command tells ESLint to lint the `src` folder). As well as add `npm run lint` to the `prepublishOnly` script so your code is linted before publishing.

```
"scripts": {
  ...
  "prepublishOnly": "npm run lint && npm test && npm run build",
  "lint": "eslint src"
}
```

---

### Jest config

If you want to use [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) (recommended) you can use the [preset provided by Rollpkg](https://github.com/rafgraph/rollpkg/blob/main/configs/jest-preset.js). The preset uses [`ts-jest`](https://github.com/kulshekhar/ts-jest) for a seamless and fully typed checked TypeScript testing experience. There is no need to install Jest as it is included with Rollpkg. In `package.json` add:

```
"jest": {
  "preset": "rollpkg"
}
```

It is also recommended to add `test`, `test:watch` and `coverage` scripts to `package.json` (the `coverage` script will open the coverage report in your browser). As well as add `npm test` to the `prepublishOnly` script so tests are run before publishing.

```
"scripts": {
  ...
  "prepublishOnly": "npm run lint && npm test && npm run build",
  "lint": "eslint src",
  "test": "jest",
  "test:watch": "jest --watchAll",
  "coverage": "npx live-server coverage/lcov-report"
}
```

The Rollpkg Jest config will automatically generate a code coverage report when Jest is run and save it in the `coverage` folder, which shouldn't be checked into version control, so also add `coverage` to `.gitignore`.

```gitignore
# .gitignore
node_modules
dist
coverage
```

---

## Build details

Rollpkg uses the TypeScript compiler to transform your code to `ES5` (or your desired target) and Rollup to create `esm`, `cjs` and `umd` builds. The TypeScript compiler uses your `tsconfig.json` with a few overrides to prevent [global type pollution](#rollpkgs-approach-to-typescripts-global-type-pollution), create source maps, and generate `*.d.ts` type files.

- [`rollpkg build`](#rollpkg-build) creates `esm`, `cjs` and `umd` builds for both development and production.
- [`rollpkg watch`](#rollpkg-watch) is lightning quick and always exits `0` so you can chain npm scripts.
- Setting [`sideEffects: false`](#sideeffects-boolean) fully enables tree-shaking.
- Production builds are minified and [dev mode code is removed](#dev-mode-code).
- [TypeScript compilation and JS APIs](#typescript-compilation-and-js-apis) available at runtime can be customized using your `tsconfig.json`.
- Source maps are created for each build with your source code included in the source map so there is no need to publish your `src` folder to `npm`.

---

### `rollpkg build`

`rollpkg build` outputs 6 build files to the `dist` folder, as well as source maps and `*.d.ts` typings.

#### ES Modules `esm` build

- **`<package-name>.esm.js`**
- The `esm` build is ready to be used by modern bundlers (e.g. Webpack) for both development and production and fully supports tree shaking. When creating production builds the bundler will minify the code and remove any code that is gated by `process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production'`.

#### CommonJS `cjs` build

- **`<package-name>.cjs.js`**
  - The `cjs` entry file that selects the development or production `cjs` build based on `process.env.NODE_ENV`, you can view what this file looks like [here](https://unpkg.com/browse/rollpkg-example-package/dist/rollpkg-example-package.cjs.js).
- **`<package-name>.cjs.development.js`**
- **`<package-name>.cjs.production.js`**
- The `cjs` build creates separate versions for development and production, as well as an entry file that selects the appropriate version.

#### Universal Module Definition `umd` build

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
- **`<package-name>.umd.development.js`**
- **`<package-name>.umd.production.js`**
- The `umd` builds are ready to be used directly in the browser from the Unpkg CDN, just add the script to `index.html`:
  ```html
  <!-- in development use -->
  <script src="https://unpkg.com/<pacakge-name>/dist/<pacakge-name>.umd.development.js"></script>

  <!-- in production use -->
  <script src="https://unpkg.com/<pacakge-name>/dist/<pacakge-name>.umd.production.js"></script>
  ```
- Your package will be available on the `window` as the PascalCase version of your `<package-name>`. For example, if your package name is `rollpkg-example-package`, then it will be available on the `window` as `RollpkgExamplePackage`.
- The `umd` build is bundled with your package `dependencies` included, but with your package `peerDependencies` listed as external globals, which are assumed to be available on the `window` as the PascalCase version of their `<package-name>`. For example, if your package has `react` as a peer dependency, then Rollpkg assumes it will be available on the `window` as `React`, which is true if [React is also loaded from the CDN](https://reactjs.org/docs/cdn-links.html).
- You can control the external globals that your `umd` build depends on and what they will be available on the `window` as by adding a `umdGlobalDependencies` object to your `package.json`. The object needs to be in the form of `{ "package-name": "GlobalName" }`, for example `{ "react-dom": "ReactDOM" }`. If `umdGlobalDependencies` is specified in your `package.json`, then Rollpkg will use that instead of the `peerDependencies` list.

---

### `rollpkg watch`

- Watches for file changes and rebuilds when changes are detected.
- Only creates `esm` and `cjs` development builds so the rebuilds are lightning quick.
- Use `ctrl c` to exit watch mode.
- Watch mode always exits `0` (non-error state) so you can chain commands in npm scripts, for example `rollpkg watch && npm run ...` (if watch mode didn't exit `0`, then `npm run ...` would never be executed). This is useful when using `npm link` for development so you can preform cleanup when exiting watch mode, for example `npm link && npm run watch && npm unlink -g`, see [Package development with `npm link`](#package-development-with-npm-link) for more info.

---

### `sideEffects: boolean`

- The `sideEffects` option in `package.json` is required by Rollpkg.
- Most packages should set `"sideEffects": false` to fully enable tree shaking. A side effect is code that effects the global space when the script is run even if the `import` is never used, for example a polyfill that automatically polyfills a feature when the script is run would set `sideEffects: true`. For more info see the [Webpack docs](https://webpack.js.org/guides/tree-shaking/#mark-the-file-as-side-effect-free) (note that Rollpkg doesn't support an array of filenames containing side effects like Webpack).
- Setting `sideEffects: false` enables the following tree-shaking optimizations:
  - `#__PURE__` annotations are injected using [`babel-plugin-annotate-pure-calls`](https://github.com/Andarist/babel-plugin-annotate-pure-calls) to help with dead code removal (note that this is the only thing Babel is used for).
  - Rollup's more forceful [treeshake options](https://rollupjs.org/guide/en/#treeshake) are enabled with `moduleSideEffects`, `propertyReadSideEffects`, `tryCatchDeoptimization`, and `unknownGlobalSideEffects` all set to `false` (note that tree-shaking is still enabled with `sideEffects: true`, just a milder version of it is used).

---

### Dev mode code

Dev mode code is code that will only run in development and will be removed from production builds. You can use `process.env.NODE_ENV` or `__DEV__` to gate dev mode code and Rollpkg will remove it from production builds:

```js
if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production') {
  // dev mode code here
}

if (__DEV__) {
  // dev mode code here
}
```

Note that `__DEV__` is shorthand for `process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production'` and Rollpkg will transform `__DEV__` into `process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production'` before proceeding to create development and production builds.

If using an `invariant` library like [tiny-invariant](https://github.com/alexreardon/tiny-invariant), then `invariant(condition, message)` will be transformed so the message is removed from production builds:

```js
import invariant from 'tiny-invariant';

// your code...
invariant(condition, 'Some informative message that takes up a lot of kbs');

// ...will be transformed into this:
process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production'
  ? invariant(condition)
  : invariant(condition, 'Some informative message that takes up a lot of kbs');

// ...and will end up like this in production builds:
invariant(condition);
```

---

### TypeScript compilation and JS APIs

> Note that for most projects [extending the Rollpkg `tsconfig`](#typescript-config) is all that's required and you can ignore this section.

Rollpkg uses the TypeScript compiler (not Babel) to transform both TS and JS code, and the TypeScript compiler uses your `tsconfig.json` to determine how to compile your code (this avoids the [limitations of using TypeScript with Babel](https://kulshekhar.github.io/ts-jest/user/babel7-or-ts) which means your code is fully type checked all the way through the build process).

By default Rollpkg will transform your code into `ES5` with access to the `DOM` APIs, but without access to non-`ES5` APIs (e.g. `Promise`, `Map`, `Set`, etc). To control how your code is compiled and what JS APIs are available at runtime the TypeScript compiler allows you to specify [`target`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#target) and [`lib`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#lib) options. The `target` option specifies the ECMAScript version that your code is compiled to (the Rollpkg default is `ES5`), and the `lib` option specifies the JS APIs that will be available at runtime, which is needed for using JS APIs that can't be compiled to the specified `target`. For example, `array.includes` and the `Promise` API cannot be compiled to `ES5` but you may find it necessary to use them in your code. Note that all JS APIs you use in your code will either need to be available in the browser or provided via a polyfill.

**Recommended best practice is to leave the `target` at `ES5` and explicitly add any additional JS APIs using the `lib` option. And then make note of these APIs in your package docs so users of your package know what polyfills (or browser limitations) are required to use your package. However, if you only want to support newer browsers, then feel free to increase the `target` to `ES6`, but make sure to note that in your package docs.**

For example, let's say you need to use the `Promise` API, your `tsconfig.json` would look like this:

> Note that when using the `lib` option you need to specify _all_ available JS APIs, including the base `ES5` APIs and `DOM` APIs.

```json
// example tsconfig.json to use the Promise API
{
  "extends": "rollpkg/configs/tsconfig.json",
  "compilerOptions": {
    "lib": ["DOM", "ES5", "ES2015.Promise"]
  }
}
```

## Rollpkg's approach to TypeScript's global type pollution

TypeScript's default behavior is to include all of the types in your `node_modules/@types` folder as part of the global scope. This allows you to use things like `process.env.NODE_ENV` and Jest's `test(...)` or `expect(...)` without causing a type error. However, it also adds a significant amount of global type pollution that you might not realize is there. This pollution can make it seem like you are writing type safe code that safely compiles to your `target` ECMAScript version (Rollpkg's default is `ES5`), but in reality you are using APIs that won't be available at runtime. For example, your `node_modules/@types` folder probably includes `node`'s types (they are required by Jest and others), so the TypeScript compiler thinks your code will have access to all of Node's APIs at runtime. If your compilation `target` is set to `ES5`, using APIs like `array.includes`, `Map`, `Set` or `Promise` won't produce a TypeScript error despite the fact that none of these can be compiled to `ES5` ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è (the TypeScript compiler assumes your code will have access to these APIs at runtime).

TypeScript does provide a [`types`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#types) compiler option for you to explicitly specify which packages are included in the global scope (note that these will be in addition to any `import`s in your code, for example if you `import * as React from 'react'` then `react`'s types will always be included). However, failing to include types that are needed in development but won't be available at runtime (e.g. Node's `process.env.NODE_ENV` and Jest's `test`) will cause a TypeScript error in development ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Also you can only specify entire packages so it is not possible to only include the `process.env` type but exclude the rest of Node's types.

Ideally [TypeScript would allow overrides](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/33407) based on file types like ESLint does, but until that happens the most widely used solution is multiple `tsconfig`s (e.g. `tsconfig.build.json`, `tsconfig.test.json`, etc) that include or exclude specific files and types (or alternatively ignoring the issue and accepting the global type pollution). Note that VS Code (and other editors) can only use one `tsconfig.json` per file tree to provide type feedback in the UI, so when using multiple `tsconfig`s it is typical to have a `tsconfig.json` file that doesn't restrict global types or files so you can benefit from UI based type feedback without unwanted type errors in the UI. That is, even with multiple `tsconfig`s, global type pollution is unavoidable in the editor UI.

#### So how does Rollpkg handle global type pollution?

- Rollpkg takes a balanced approach - it eliminates global type pollution when building, but allows it when editing.
- The [Rollpkg `tsconfig`](https://github.com/rafgraph/rollpkg/blob/main/configs/tsconfig.json) that you can extend in your `tsconfig.json` doesn't restrict the types available in the global scope to provide a smooth editor experience (VS Code uses your `tsconfig.json` for type checking).
- When you run `rollpkg build` or `rollpkg watch` only files that are part of the build are type checked, and `node_modules/@types` that are not imported are excluded to prevent global type pollution (your `tsconfig.json` is used for the build, but with a `types: []` override). Also, `process.env.NODE_ENV` is stubbed so it won't cause an error before it is transformed during the build process.
- Note that you may see a TypeScript error when running `rollpkg build` or `rollpkg watch` that doesn't show up in your editor or when running `npx tsc` (which uses your `tsconfig.json`). This usually happens because you are using a JS API that is not included in your `tsconfig.json`'s `lib` option, but is included in the global scope when editing via `node_modules/@types` (e.g. `array.includes`, `Promise`, etc). The solution is to explicitly add this JS API to your `tsconfig.json`'s `lib` option so Rollpkg will include it in the build process. For how to do this see the [TypeScript compilation and JS APIs](#typescript-compilation-and-js-apis) section.

## Package development with `npm link`

One way to develop packages is to use the package in a live demo app as you're working on it. Using `rollpkg watch` with [`npm link`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/commands/npm-link) allows you to see live changes in your demo app as you make changes to your package code. Running `npm link` in the package directory will link the package to global `node_modules`, and then running `npm link <package-name>` in the demo app directory will link the package from global `node_modules` to your demo app. A good way to set this up is to add a `dev` script to `package.json` (note that `... && npm unlink -g` removes the link from global `node_modules` after you're done with the `watch` script):

> For a real world example of how to do this see the example package and corresponding demo app: [rollpkg-example-package](https://github.com/rafgraph/rollpkg-example-package) and [rollpkg-example-package-demo](https://github.com/rafgraph/rollpkg-example-package-demo)

```
"scripts": {
  "dev": "npm link && npm run watch && npm unlink -g",
  "build": "rollpkg build",
  "watch": "rollpkg watch",
  ...
}
```

## FAQ

- **Does Rollpkg remove dev mode code from production builds?**
  - Yes, see the [Dev mode code](#dev-mode-code) section.
- **Does Rollpkg prevent global type pollution in my builds?**
  - Yes, see [Rollpkg's approach to TypeScript's global type pollution](#rollpkgs-approach-to-typescripts-global-type-pollution).
- **How do I use Rollpkg with JavaScript?**
  - The only file that needs to be TypeScript is the entry file `src/index.ts`, the rest of your files can written in JavaScript. This is because Rollpkg uses the TypeScript complier to compile both TypeScript and JavaScript files.
- **Does Rollpkg use Babel?**
  - No, Rollpkg uses the TypeScript compiler to translate both TS and JS code to `ES5`, this avoids the [limitations of using TypeScript with Babel](https://kulshekhar.github.io/ts-jest/user/babel7-or-ts) which means your code is fully type checked all the way through the build process. Also, by not using Babel the `tsconfig.json` becomes the single source of truth for how your code is compiled and eliminates the complexity and confusion caused by having both a `tsconfig.json` and a `babel.config.json`.
- **Can I use a `browserslist` with Rollpkg?**
  - No, and that's a good thing when creating a package. A `browserslist` is incredibly useful when creating an app that's run in the browser. The `browserslist` lets your build system (e.g. Create React App, Gatsby, Next.js, Webpack with Babel, etc) know what browsers to support, but when creating a package that is meant to be used in a variety of apps with different browser requirements it can cause compatibility issues.
- **Can I specify a build target other than `ES5`?**
  - Yes, but it is not recommended for compatibility reasons as you don't know who is going to use your package. See this [explanation from Rollup](https://github.com/rollup/rollup/wiki/pkg.module#wait-it-just-means-import-and-export--not-other-future-javascript-features) for why ESModules should be transpiled to `ES5`. If you're sure you want to change it then set the `target` option in your `tsconfig.json` to the desired ECMAScript version. For more info see the [TypeScript compilation and JS APIs](#typescript-compilation-and-js-apis) section
- **Can I use the new React JSX runtime?**
  - Not yet, and you probably shouldn't for compatibility reasons. If you were to use the [new JSX runtime](https://reactjs.org/blog/2020/09/22/introducing-the-new-jsx-transform.html) in your package it would mean that your package can only be used in projects with React versions that support the JSX runtime, which significantly limits compatibility. There are also some complexity issues around supporting the JSX runtime in Rollpkg. The new React JSX transform allows you to avoid importing React in files that use JSX, however, the JSX runtime is not part of React's UMD build. This means that the Rollpkg UMD build still needs to use the `React.createElement(...)` API regardless, which makes the build process more complex.
